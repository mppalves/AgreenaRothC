#' Effects of crop retainment on carbon
#' @title Effect of covered soil on C flows
#' @param x Logical vector with months where the soil is covered. If only a single value is passed the whole period will be treated homogeneously.
#' @description The soil cover factor (c) slows decomposition if growing plants are present. In earlier version of the model this factor is called the 'retainment factor.
#' @return A vector with the rate modifying factor. (0.6 for covered soil and 1 for bare soil)
