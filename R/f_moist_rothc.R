#' Effects of moisture on decomposition rates according to the RothC model
#'
#' Calculates the effects of moisture (precipitation and pan evaporation) on
#' decomposition rates according to the RothC model.
#'
#' @title Effect of moisture on C flows
#' @param pp A vector with monthly precipitation (mm).
#' @param et A vector with same length with open pan evaporation or
#' evapotranspiration (mm).
#' @param s_thick Soil thickness in cm. Default for Rothamsted is 23 cm.
#' @param pClay Percent clay.
#' @param pE Evaporation coefficient. If open pan evaporation is used pE=0.75.
#' If Potential evaporation is used, pE=1.0.
#' @param soil_cover Logical vector with months where the soil is covered. If only a single value is passed the whole period will be treated homogeneously.
#' @description Extended version of \code{\link[SoilR]{fW.RothC}} coping with different soil cover regimes.
#' @return A vector with the rate modifying factor.
