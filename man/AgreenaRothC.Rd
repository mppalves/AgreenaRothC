\value{
returns a data frame with average (AV) and standard deviation (SD)
of surface temperature (TS), bias corrected precipitation (PRECTOTCORR) and
Evapotranspiration Energy Flux (EVPTRNS).

\description{
Calculates soil carbon stocks for the RothC spin up period,
baseline and scenario runs.
}
\details{
Agreena RothC initializes RothC biomass inputs by inverse modeling
to calibrate total soil carbon stocks with estimates generated by ISRIC
soilgrids. The estimates biomass inputs are used to spin up the model until
soil carbon stocks equilibrium is reached for each soil carbon compartment.
Those values are then used to initialize Baseline and scenario runs.
